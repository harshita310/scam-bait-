Detection Agent — Rule-based + ML (TF-IDF + SVM) Cascading Detection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Works exactly like a cascading pipeline:

    Step 1: Rule-based scoring
            → If score >= 0.7  → SCAM (rules are confident, done)

    Step 2: ML Model (TF-IDF + LinearSVC)
            → If ML confident  → Return ML result (done)

    Step 3: Fallback
            → If nothing triggered → NOT SCAM

This is the same cascading pattern as the friend's approach,
but trained on 100 samples instead of 10.
